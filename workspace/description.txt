Admin Dashboard - Description
This is a responsive Admin Dashboard interface designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a clean, minimal layout suitable for managing users, settings, and viewing reports. The design includes:

Header: A green top bar featuring the dashboard title and a toggle switch for dark mode.

Sidebar Navigation: A vertical menu on the left with navigation links to Home, Users, and Settings.

Main Content Area: Displays a welcome message and placeholder text where charts, tables, or reports can be inserted.
